⚡ About Me
I am a Software Engineer with a passion for building scalable, high-performance applications and immersive digital experiences. With a strong foundation in Full-Stack Development, I bridge the gap between robust backend architecture and interactive frontend interfaces.

Architectural Focus: I specialize in MVC and MVVM patterns to ensure code maintainability and scalability.

3D & Innovation: I enjoy pushing the boundaries of the web using Three.js and Babylon.js for 3D visualization.

Enterprise Experience: Proficient in the .NET and Java ecosystems, as well as high-productivity platforms like OutSystems.

System Mindset: Experienced in managing Linux environments and optimizing server performance with Nginx.
